  <h1> Apple iPhone 7 Review<h1>
<p>
  There were many rumors about the iPhone 7 not having an earphone jack and we would have to use some sort of bluetooth headphone. Yesterday, Apple revealed that was indeed true. In my opinion, I don’t like the idea of the iPhone 7 not having an earphone jack because I like have having wired headphones plugged in. Although you can still use wired headphones, you won’t be able to charge your phone while doing so. Another reason as to why I do not like the idea of having Apple AirPods is because they are easier to loose. Let’s be honest, who would really put them back into their case? Other than the iPhone 7 not having an earphone jack, I do like the idea of the display being 25 percent brighter than the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.
